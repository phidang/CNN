Airplanees (Side) dataset. Collected by undergrads at
California Institute of Technology (Feb '01) from the web.

1074 images of motorbikes from the side. 
Jpeg format. Variables size, but should be >100 pixels in width.

ImageData.mat is a Matlab file containing the variable
SubDir_Data which is an 8 x 1074 matrix.
Each column of this matrix hold the coordinates of 
the bike within the image, in the form:

[x_bot_left y_bot_left x_top_left y_top_left ... 
 x_top_right y_top_right x_bot_right y_bot_right]
